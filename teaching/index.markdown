 My teaching practice is characterized by careful *design of learning experiences to grow student cognition* from the perspective of *action, process object, schema* (APOS) theory, providing *frequent and meaningful feedback* including through *active learning* techniques and *assessment for learning*, and giving students--especially struggling ones--a contextualized opportunity to learn effective college success strategies through scaffolded metacognitive reflection, including but not limited to *exam wrappers*.
