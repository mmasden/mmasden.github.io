In a project-based setting for students with code background, I make assignments in Jupyter notebooks. (I would also be happy to use RMarkdown for this purpose, but I personally use Jupyter more often.)

*I assigned this activity, and others like it, to an undergraduate student I was mentoring. They had taken a discrete math class and introductory Python, but were interested in learning probability theory, especially with respect to Markov processes on graphs.*
