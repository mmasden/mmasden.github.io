I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Computer Science department at the University of Puget Sound, and the director of the newly-minted [Data Analytics](https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/data-analytics) program, spearheading the development of the Interdisciplinary Data Analytics minor. You can contact me at [mmasden@pugetsound.edu](mailto:mmasden@pugetsound.edu). Read more about the program's founding [here](https://www.pugetsound.edu/stories/university-puget-sound-announces-new-interdisciplinary-data-analytics-minor).

I earned my Ph.D. from the [Mathematics department](https://math.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon in 2023, with advisor [Dev Sinha](https://pages.uoregon.edu/dps/index.php). 

From September 2023 to June 2024, I was an Institute Postdoctoral Fellow at [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu/), including participating in the Fall program [*Math + Neuroscience*](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-f23/). 
A highlight about my research during the program is posted at [MathInstitutes.org](https://mathinstitutes.org/highlights/exploiting-combinatorial-regularity-for-relu-neural-networks).  

My dissertation research,  *Accessing the Topological Properties of Neural Network Functions,* lies at the intersection of applied topology and machine learning. My general research interests are towards the application of mathematics -- especially topology, geometry, combinatorics, and algebra -- in the support of the computational and natural sciences, such as for data analysis and the development of new theoretical models.
