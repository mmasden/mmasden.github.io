I earned my Ph.D. from the [Mathematics department](https://math.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon, with advisor [Dev Sinha](https://pages.uoregon.edu/dps/index.php). 

My dissertation research,  *Accessing the Topological Properties of Neural Network Functions,* lies at the intersection of applied topology and machine learning. My general research interests are towards the application of mathematics -- especially topology, geometry, combinatorics, and algebra -- in the support of the computational and natural sciences, such as for data analysis and the development of new theoretical models.  

I am also an experienced teacher, with experience as instructor of record / certificated teacher at the college and high school levels, respectively.
