## Research Interests 

I blend mathematical theory from a range of fields including **topology, geometry, combinatorics and algebra,** to approach foundational questions about the **behavior and properties of neural network functions.** My thesis uses algebraic constructions from oriented matroid theory, geometric ideas from piecewise linear Morse theory, and fundamental constructions from algebraic topology.  I write code, mostly in **Python (Pytorch)** and **Sage**, to obtain experimental and empirical measurements of the objects I study.
	 
My background and research experiences additionally include applications of graph theory and topology in **computational chemistry, materials science, and computer vision.** I am interested in finding **new applications of computational topology** in the mathematical and natural sciences, and enjoy working on interdisciplinary projects.
