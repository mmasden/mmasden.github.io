### Research Interests 

My most current research lies at the intersection of applied algebraic topology and machine learning. I am also interested in pursuing applications of computational topology in the mathematical sciences. 


### [My Papers](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Masden%2C+M) 

[Algorithmic Determination of the Combinatorial Structure of the Linear Regions of ReLU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07696). 2022.

[ChemNetworks 2.2 (polyhedra.c)](https://gitlab.com/aurora-clark-public/chemnetworksv2-2/-/blob/master/polyhedra.c).  

*During an undergraduate internship at Washington State University, I implemented and iterated on a C algorithm (from an existing R algorithm) for detecting polyhedral structure in molecular dynamics simulations. This experience inspired my interest in computational geometry and topology.*
